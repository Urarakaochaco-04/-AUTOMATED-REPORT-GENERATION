### ‚úÖ **Project Overview **

This project finds the average power level of anime characters and creates a PDF report with a graph and a table using Python.


### üìå **1. What is This Project About?**

This project is all about reading data from a file (CSV file) that contains the names of anime and their characters‚Äô power levels. Using Python, it processes the data, finds the average power level for each anime, makes a graph (bar chart), and finally puts all the information into a PDF file. The final report looks clean and is easy to understand. It includes both the data in table format and a visual chart.


### üìä **2. What Does the Code Do?**

* First, it loads the CSV file called `Task 2.csv` using **Pandas**, which is a library that helps you work with data easily.
* Then, it calculates the average power level for each anime by grouping the data.
* It sorts the results from highest to lowest so we can quickly see which anime has the strongest characters.
* After that, it uses **Matplotlib** to create a bar chart where you can clearly see the power level of each anime.
* Finally, it uses **FPDF** to create a PDF report. This report includes:

  * A title
  * A small description
  * A table that shows each anime and its average power level
  * The bar chart created earlier

The final file is saved as `Task 2.pdf`.


### üìà **3. What Tools Did I Use?**

Here are the Python libraries used in this project:

* **Pandas** ‚Äì Used to read and work with the CSV data. It helps calculate the average power level.
* **Matplotlib** ‚Äì Used to draw the bar chart (the visual part).
* **FPDF** ‚Äì Used to create the PDF report with text, table, and image.

All these are free Python tools that make working with data and reports super easy.


### üí° **4. Why is This Project Useful?**

This project is useful for students or anyone who needs to turn raw data into a report. It can be used in real-life projects where we need to:

* Analyze student marks
* Compare product sales
* Track scores in sports
* or even just make a personal project like this one using anime data

It teaches you how to automate report-making using just a simple Python script, which can save a lot of time compared to doing everything manually in Word or Excel.


### üìÅ **5. What is the Output?**

The final output is a clean and simple PDF report (`Task 2.pdf`) that includes:

* A title and small subtitle
* A table showing each anime and its average power level
* A chart that helps you understand the results visually

The PDF looks professional and is ready to submit or share.


### ‚úÖ **6. Conclusion (As a Student)**

This project helped me learn how to:

* Work with CSV files
* Use Python for data analysis
* Create graphs
* Make automated PDF reports

It‚Äôs a fun and creative way to learn Python and can be reused for many other topics. Instead of manually writing reports, I can now let Python do the work for me!
